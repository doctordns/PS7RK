# PowerShell 7 Resource Kit


Working thoughts on a PS7 Resource Kit series - a work in progress

## Overview

The PS7RK is a series of in-depth books about core technologies, and how to use PowerShell 7 to manage them.
There would probably never bee an actual box set of books.
But such concept remains an interesting area for further discussion, especially for the electronic book market.

Each book is intended to be an in-depth discussion of a particular technology. For example, Active Directory, DNS, and Azure.
A book examines a technology in-depth as well as showing you how how to manage it, which means some books may be larger than others.
In some cases, specifically Azure, we might need to have several books, rather than one huge one.

For readers taking professional exams, the books cover every aspect of relevant exams (and we'#ll publish a mapping of book chapters to exam syllabus objectives.
As each book is in-depth, the author would cover every cmdlet in the related technology modules.

The books would use a single network structure wich a common domain/forest name, consistent IP addreses and host names, services distributed to specific hosts.
The books are supplimented by a set of VM installation scripts to create Hyper-V VMs. 
A similar set of scripts for Azure based reesources would be a nice to have.

## Governence
We are to create an Technical Content Board to ensure the technical coverage and overall quality of the series.
A group of say 5-6 people would suffice.
To ensure quality and depty, it would be desirable to get one or more Microsoft MVP, MCT, or possibly RD individuals involved.
Microsoft Product team assistance for some technologies might be possible.
