# PowerShell 7 Resource Kit


Working thoughts on a PS7 Resource Kit series - a work in progress

## Overview

The PS7RK is a series of in-depth books about core technologies, and how to use PowerShell 7 to manage them. 
The ideas is to have 15 or more books that cover all the core Microsoft technologies and services, not dissimilar to the old Windows NT and WIndow Server resource kits of years gone by.

There would probably never bee an actual box set of books.
But such concept remains an interesting area for further discussion, especially for the electronic book market.

Each book is an in-depth discussion of a particular technology and related WIndows services and Powershell commands. 
A book examines a technology such as AD or DNS, in-depth.
The book also shows you how to manage it.
Thus, some books may be larger than others.
And in some cases, specifically Azure, we might need to have several books, rather than one huge one.

For readers taking professional exams, the books cover every aspect of relevant exams (and we'll publish a mapping of book chapters to exam syllabus objectives.
As each book is in-depth, the author would cover every cmdlet in the modules supported by the technology. 

The books would use a single network structure wich a common domain/forest name, consistent IP addreses and host names, services distributed to specific hosts.
The books are supplimented by a set of VM installation scripts to create Hyper-V VMs. 
A similar set of scripts for Azure based reesources would be a nice to have.

## Development Governence

We are to create an Technical Content Board to ensure the technical coverage and overall quality of the series.
A group of say 5-6 people would suffice.
To ensure quality and depty, it would be desirable to get one or more Microsoft MVP, MCT, or possibly RD individuals involved.
Microsoft Product team assistance for some technologies might be possible.
