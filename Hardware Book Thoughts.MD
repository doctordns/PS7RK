This is likely to be a bit less interesting but dives deep into the hardware.
Some of this content is guided by the NT 3.1 Reskit Perfmon Book.

In terms of certificatin, this content is 'below' the Microsoft certs.
The book should track at least CompTIA [A+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/a) and possibly [Server+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/server)).

It might also be nice to track agasint Apple ACMT and Cisco CCT.
